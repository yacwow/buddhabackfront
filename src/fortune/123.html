<p>As we flip the calendar to <strong>July</strong>, I'm reminded of a gardener who, halfway through the season,
    steps<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;back to survey his fields. Just like him, <strong>assessing the first half of your year can
        reveal much about the fruits yet to come</strong>.</p>
<p>Has your year been a lush field of successes, or are you still tending to the seeds of projects and dreams?<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;Regardless, the <strong>second half</strong> of the year brings with it the promise of a <strong>fresh
        start</strong>.</p>
<p>This month, our <strong>July Feng Shui forecast</strong> uncovers the myriad opportunities waiting to sprout in
    your<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;life. Are you ready to nurture new beginnings and see what July has in store? Let's dig in and
    discover the<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;potential that the rest of the year holds.</p>


<h2><strong>Rat</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Birth Year: 1936, 1948, 1960, 1972, 1984, 1996, 2008, 2020</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0474/1840/9121/files/Rat_160x160.png?v=1654013330"
        alt="Rat - July Horoscope" data-href="" style="height: auto;" /></p>
<p>Rat, despite many positives this month, the presence of the <em>#5 Misfortune Star</em> demands caution,
    particularly<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;regarding your health and safety. This troublesome Earth Star can herald unexpected
    conflicts, illnesses, financial<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;setbacks, and disasters. Stay vigilant and take preventative
    measures to safeguard your wellbeing and protect your<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;interests.</p>
<p>Take the necessary precautions to mitigate the effects of the Misfortune Star. Feng Shui cures like the <a
        href="https://buddhaandkarma.com/products/triple-protection-bracelet" target="_blank"><strong>Triple Protection
            Bracelet</strong></a> help you avoid the bad luck coming your way. You’ll also benefit from attracting
    good<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;luck–the <strong>Feng Shui PixiuBracelet</strong> is designed for this reason.</p>
<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Ox</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Birth Year: 1937, 1949, 1961, 1973, 1985, 1997, 2009, 2021</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0474/1840/9121/files/Ox_160x160.png?v=1654013434"
        alt="Ox - July Horoscope" data-href="" style="height: auto;" /></p>
<p>Ox, the <em>#3 Quarrelsome Star</em> is active in your chart this month, heightening the risk of quarrels and<br>
    &nbsp; &nbsp;misunderstandings. This influence might make you more irritable and prone to conflicts over trivial
    matters. To<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;preserve valuable relationships and avoid potential legal issues, it’s crucial to
    manage your emotions carefully.<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;For those married, be aware of increased tension with your spouse
    and strive for harmony.</p>
<p>This is an ideal time to seek support from the <a
        href="https://buddhaandkarma.com/products/amethyst-purifying-bracelet" target="_blank"><strong>Amethyst Soothing
            Bracelet</strong></a>. Amethyst is a crystal known for its purifying properties, diffusing tensions in
    your<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;surroundings. Combine it with the <a
        href="https://buddhaandkarma.com/products/aquamarine-bracelet" target="_blank"><strong>Aquamarine
            Bracelet</strong></a> to enhance your communication and avoid<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;misunderstandings.</p>
<h2><strong>Tiger</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Birth Year: 1938, 1950, 1962, 1974, 1986, 1998, 2010, 2022</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0474/1840/9121/files/Tiger_160x160.png?v=1654013463"
        alt="Tiger - July Horoscope" data-href="" style="height: auto;" /></p>
<p>Tiger, the risk of legal disputes looms this month, primarily stemming from challenges in managing your temper.
    While<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;the annual <em>#6 Heavenly Star</em> brightens your prospects, focusing on settling scores
    could undermine your<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;progress. In disagreements, opting to yield graciously can lead to greater
    happiness and preserve peace. If you're<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;married, this advice is doubly important—practice patience
    and understanding with your spouse to maintain a tranquil<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;home life.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Rabbit</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Birth Year: 1939, 1951, 1963, 1975, 1987, 1999, 2011</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0474/1840/9121/files/Rabbit_160x160.png?v=1654013489"
        alt="Rabbit - July Horoscope" data-href="" style="height: auto;" /></p>
<p>This is not an ideal time for you, Rabbits, to launch new ventures. The energies of betrayal are particularly
    strong<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;now. Even with meticulous planning, you may face unexpected setbacks. Exercise caution in
    your dealings and<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;double-check all your actions. Be wary of relying too much on others. For married
    Rabbits, stay vigilant against<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;potential interference from outside parties that could disrupt your
    relationship.</p>

<p> </p>
<h2><strong>Dragon</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Birth Year: 1940, 1952, 1964, 1976, 1988, 2000, 2012</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0474/1840/9121/files/Dragon_160x160.png?v=1654013521"
        alt="Dragon - July Horoscope" data-href="" style="height: auto;" /></p>
<p>Dragon, your month looks promising as the alignment of the <em>#8 Wealth Star</em> with the <em>#2 Illness
        Star</em><br> &nbsp; &nbsp;in your sector forms the powerful <em>Sum-of-Ten</em>, granting you exceptional
    completion luck. Achieving your<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;goals will feel easier than usual, and your successes will motivate
    you to set even higher ambitions. While you<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;enjoy this prosperous period, remember to take care of
    your health and not overextend yourself. This month also<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;offers favorable prospects for meeting new
    people and finding love if you are single.</p>

    strength, and pair it with a Labradorite Protection Bracelet for clarity and balance.</p>
<h2><strong>Horse</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Birth Year: 1942, 1954, 1966, 1978, 1990, 2002, 2014, 2026</strong></p>
<p>The Horse is supported by the #8 Victory Star, bringing success and achievement in various aspects of life. Whether
    in your career or personal goals, now is the time to take bold steps forward. However, be mindful of burnout—take
    time to recharge and enjoy moments of rest. To maintain a balanced energy, wear the Amber Success Bracelet to keep
    your energy high, and the Clear Quartz Energy Bracelet to support clarity and motivation.</p>
<h2><strong>Goat</strong></h2>
<p><strong>Birth Year: 1943, 1955, 1967, 1979, 1991, 2003, 2015, 2027</strong></p>
